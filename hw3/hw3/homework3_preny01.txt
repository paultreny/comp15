// Your job is to choose one of the data structures covered in class that can 
// map a character string to a integer, with the objective of optimizing
// retrieval time. You are expected to justify your decision.
//
// I've chosen to use a Hash function for comparing the stop words, and
// an AVL tree for keeping track of the unique words and their number of
// occurances.
//
// I did this for a couple of reasons. A hash table for the small number of
// of stop words (319) means that it is relatively easy to compare a hash of
// a word as it is input, and if there is a conflict, then it is ignored, as
// it shares the same address as a stopword. This is much better than 319x 
// comparisons each time we come across a stopword!
