============================================================================= 
// Your job is to choose one of the data structures covered in class that can 
// map a character string to a integer, with the objective of optimizing
// retrieval time. You are expected to justify your decision.
=============================================================================
// 
// I've chosen to use a Hash function for comparing the stop words, and
// an AVL tree for keeping track of the unique words and their number of
// occurances.
//
// I did this for a couple of reasons. A hash table for the small number of
// of stop words (319) means that it is relatively easy to compare a hash of
// a word as it is input, and if there is a conflict, then it is ignored, as
// it shares the same address as a stopword. This is much better than 319x 
// comparisons each time we come across a stopword!
// 
// The choice to use an AVLTree was based on the fact that it is the fastest
// Map type implementation that I am familiar with. I had thought of using a
// heap/priority queue, but ultimately decided against it, mostly for the sake
// of my own sanity, after trying to make one that used more than one type of
// key.
// 
// I chose the murmurhash3 hash function for number of reasons. I wanted to
// minimize any chance of collisions, as that would give me false positives
// when comparing stopwords. I also wanted a hash function that worked fairly
// quickly, as it would be called often. With a lot of XOR ^ bit shifting and
// a 'divide and conquer' approach made it a winner in my eyes.
